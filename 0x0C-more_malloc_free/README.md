This function allocates memory using `malloc` and checks for allocation failure.
This function concatenates two strings (s1 and s2) and returns a newly allocated string that contains s1 followed by the first n bytes of s2, terminated by a null character ('\0').
The `_calloc` function allocates memory for an array of elements, similar to the standard library function `calloc`. It initializes the allocated memory to zero.
