This function allocates memory using `malloc` and checks for allocation failure.
This function concatenates two strings (s1 and s2) and returns a newly allocated string that contains s1 followed by the first n bytes of s2, terminated by a null character ('\0').
The `_calloc` function allocates memory for an array of elements, similar to the standard library function `calloc`. It initializes the allocated memory to zero.
This function creates an array of integers containing values from `min` to `max`, inclusive.
This project implements a custom `_realloc` function in C, which reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`.
